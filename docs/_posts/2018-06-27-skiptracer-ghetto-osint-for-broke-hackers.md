# Abstract

Initial attack vectors for recon usually involve utilizing pay-for-data/API (Recon-NG), or paying to utilize transforms (Maltego) to get data mining results. Using some basic python webscraping of PII paywall sites to compile passive information on a target on a ramen noodle budget. The modules will allow queries for phone/email/screen names/real names/addresses/IP/Hostname/breach credentials etc.. 

This demo will go over the basic outline of using the script, the problems and pitfalls of dealing with scrapers, and how it will help you collect relevant information about a target to help expand your attack surface.

# Abstract

"This presentation shows how data driven techniques can be used to provide vision and establish  relationships between users and participants of DarkWeb forums. These relationships can provide clues to uncover and reveal tracks of malicious actors. Things such as chat room transcripts and forum 
data are used can be used to build graphical relationships. This provides a context where it is possible to use machine learning algorithms to unmask relationships and profile users of these dark forums. Some of the methods used include Machine Learning Algorithms such as Googles PageRank. Once this users are profiled it is possible to predict behaviors, gaining further understanding of actors using these forums to obfuscate and evade attribution. "

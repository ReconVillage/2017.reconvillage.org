# Abstract

"Sure, WiFi hacking has been around for a while, and everyone knows about tools like airmon-ng, kismet, et al. But what if you just want to view a list of all networks in your area AND see all devices connected to each network? Or maybe you want to know who's hogging all the bandwidth (and maybe deauth them if they use too much)? Or, what if you want to know when a certain someone's cell phone is nearby. Or perhaps you'd like to know if your Airbnb host's IP Camera is uploading video to the cloud?

For all these use-cases, I've developed a new tool called ""trackerjacker"". In this talk, we'll use this tool to explore some of the surprisingly-informative data floating around in the radio space, and you'll come away with a new skill point or two in your radio hacking skill tree, as well as a new magical weapon... I mean tool."

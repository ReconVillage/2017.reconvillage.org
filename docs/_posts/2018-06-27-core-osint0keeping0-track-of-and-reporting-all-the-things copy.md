# Abstract

> Your client gives you their requirement, "find the social media accounts of the target person and any friends they may have". Simple enough. You execute your Standard Operating Procedures (you DO have a SOP, right?) and begin running tools, using your sock puppets, scraping web sites, and finding a ton of data. You've got CSVs, text output, images, URLs....OH MY! 

> How do you keep track of all this data and, more importantly, how do you ensure that you can report on it and have covered all the pivot points for the OSINT investigation?

> As OSINTers, pentesters, defenders, PIs, and others, we can easily get swamped in data. Join me as we look at some bad, some good, and some amazing methods of keeping your investigation on track.

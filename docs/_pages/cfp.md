***Note:***
*Please do not submit to Recon Village CFP if you are not already planning to attend DEF CON China 2018 as **we are unable to provide any speaker assistance in terms of DEFCON Badges / travel / accommodation expenses**. Hoteliers do not love us and we cannot help you in sorting out your VISA queries either. If you are already attending DEFCON and would like to speak, please send in your proposal through the CFP form.*

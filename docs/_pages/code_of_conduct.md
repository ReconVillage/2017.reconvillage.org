Recon Village is an Open Space with Talks, Live Demos, Workshops, Discussions, HackAthons, CTFs with a common focus on Reconnaissance and Open Source Intelligence. 

We do not condone harassment against any participant, for any reason. Harassment includes deliberate intimidation and targeting individuals in a manner that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or afraid.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We reserve the right to respond to harassment in the manner we deem appropriate, including but not limited to expulsion without refund and referral to the relevant authorities.

This Code of Conduct applies to everyone participating at Recon Village - from attendees and exhibitors to speakers, press, volunteers, and Goons.

Anyone can report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you can contact a Recon Village Volunteer (All volunteers wear a Recon Village Crew Member Tshirt), go to the registration desk, or info booth.

We and our Volunteering staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel security, local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of Recon Village.

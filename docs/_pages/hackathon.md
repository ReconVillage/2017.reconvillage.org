Do you fancy writing some code this DEFCON and make something productive? We make sure that the concentration music plays on, energy drinks flow while you compete for solving some interesting problems using Recon/OSINT. We are sure the Hacker environment at DEFCON helps in such challenges and that's the reason we are hosting a HACKATHON this year at DEFCON 26 Vegas. Believe us, we can't be more excited. 

With this HACKATHON, we strive to achieve multiple objectives at the same time. You and your team distil a visionary concept down to an actionable solution. You get a sense of achievement. You meet like minded people. Community goes bigger with your contribution. Everybody Wins.
